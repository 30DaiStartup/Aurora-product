## Core Frameworks

Foundational intellectual property and methodologies that define the Aurora approach.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[ControlFactors]] | **Control Factors Framework** - The three domains of power (Dominion, Contingency, Influence) that translate insight into action. Academic publication defining how actors express control over their operating environment through strategic choices. |
| [[SuperCycleOperatingSystem]] | **SuperCycle Operating System** - Complete specification of the three-phase strategic loop (Discovery, Optimality, Simulation) including roles, rituals, artifacts, and the SuperCycle Manifesto. The "Agile for Strategy" methodology. |
| [[AuroraSuperCycleIndustryReport]] | **Industry Development Report** - Comprehensive blueprint for commercializing SuperCycle as both a software platform and professional discipline. Includes certification architecture, software ecosystem specs, and go-to-market strategy. |

---

## Discovery Phase

Materials related to the first phase of the SuperCycle - understanding the truth about the landscape.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[LIST_DiscoveryProcess]] | **LIST Model Guide** - Step-by-step methodology for Discovery using LIST (Landscape, Issues, Stakeholders, Trends). Includes Narrative Estimate creation, stakeholder analysis, and trend identification via STEEPLED framework. |
| [[LIST_Transcript]] | **LIST Conceptual Explanation** - Transcript explaining how Discovery has never been done this way before and requires AI to automate the issues stage. Covers transformation from narrative estimate to market segment selection. |
| [[STEEPLED]] | **STEEPLED Analysis Framework** - Training guide for the eight-factor macro-environment analysis (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, Ethical, Demographic). Used to identify Contingency Control Factors. |

---

## Optimality Phase

Materials related to the second phase - making strategic choices.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[AnglesOfAttack]] | **Angles of Attack Framework** - The four generic strategic curves (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) describing all business evolution. Explains how established companies can compete with disruptive innovators through programmable superiority criteria. |
| [[SuperiorityAnalysisTranscript]] | **Superiority Analysis Workshop** - Full transcript of the CI 200 workshop covering finite vs infinite games, the Stochasm concept, superiority criteria (Satisfiers, Drivers, Disruptors), and the Growth Champion mindset. |

---

## Mindsets & Philosophy

Foundational concepts about the Missionary and Mercenary mindsets that underpin strategic decision-making.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[M&M]] | **Missionary & Mercenary Concepts** - Comprehensive extraction of concepts from "The Missionary and The Mercenary" book. Defines the two mindsets, their strengths/weaknesses, and how they apply across Discovery, Optimality, and Simulation phases. |

---

## Internal Materials

Internal Aurora discussions and planning materials.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[AuroraStrategyTranscript]] | **Strategy Planning Session** - Internal discussion on Aurora's pivot to the Intelligence Operating System product. Covers organizational restructuring, resource allocation, and milestone-based success metrics. |

## Quick Reference: Key Concepts

### The SuperCycle Phases
1. **Discovery** - Revealing truth about the landscape (LIST model)
2. **Optimality** - Making strategic choices (Angles of Attack, FITU)
3. **Simulation** - Testing the strategy (Wargaming, Action Graph)

### Control Factors
- **Dominion** - What you control
- **Contingency** - What nobody controls (STEEPLED)
- **Influence** - What others control that you might influence

### The Four Roles
- **Landscape Architect** - Owns Discovery, Missionary mindset
- **Superiority Strategist** - Owns Optimality, Mercenary mindset
- **Simulation Commander** - Owns Simulation, Champion mindset
- **SuperCycle Master** - Orchestrates the process

### Key Artifacts
- **The LIST** - Discovery output (Landscape, Issues, Stakeholders, Trends)
- **IGC** - Investment Grade Conjecture (Optimality output)
- **Actionable Esteem** - Simulation output with probability scores

### Superiority Criteria
- **Satisfiers** - Table stakes (never rewarded for over-delivery)
- **Drivers** - Competitive differentiators (temporary advantage)
- **Disruptors** - New performance dimensions (Gamma/Delta moves)

### Mindsets
- **Missionary** - Idealist, infinite game, seeks whole truth
- **Mercenary** - Pragmatist, finite game, focused on winning
- **Champion** - Balanced blend of both mindsets

## The Infinite Game Context

### The Vietnam Lesson

In January 1968, the North Vietnamese launched the Tet Offensive - what many scholars point to as the turning point in the war when the United States started losing.

**Key Insight**: The US was playing to win; the North Vietnamese were playing for survival.

> "We didn't lose the game, we just ran out of time." - Vince Lombardi

**The Distinction:**
- **Finite Players**: Playing to win (US in Vietnam, traditional corporations)
- **Infinite Players**: Playing to keep playing (North Vietnamese, adaptive companies)

If you're a finite player in an infinite game, you will eventually fumble the ball through **unforced errors**.

## The CI Profession's Existential Challenge

### Historical Pattern

After 122 months of sustained economic growth since the Great Recession, the yield curve has once again started to invert - suggesting recession within 18 months.

**Historical Reality**: Every time competitive intelligence has failed to attach itself to the only metric that matters - **growth** - there has been tremendous bloodletting:
- Programs cut entirely
- Seen as overhead
- Little regard for day-to-day activities

> "If a competitive intelligence program is seen as overhead, it will be cut with extreme prejudice."

### The Solution: Growth Champions

The CI 200 workshop is designed to show you how to become a **growth champion** - the analyst and influencer who helps colleagues see that growth is a programmable activity.

## Prerequisites for Intelligence Yield

### The Attitude Adjustment

**Humility is a prerequisite for intelligence to have a yield.**

Without humility, there is no yield potential for intelligence whatsoever.

> "Pride is the salve that deadens the pain of stupidity."

There are many things we believe we know - assumptions about the marketplace, ourselves, and competitors - that are untrue and misleading.

### The Stochasm

**Definition**: The difference between what you think you know and what you actually know.

This is the first job of the intelligence program - organizations believe they know more about reality than they actually do. Wherever this gap exists, intelligence has the potential to have a yield.

## The Geometry of Truth (Perspective)

### The Cylinder Analogy

Imagine a cylinder hanging in space with two different light sources:
- Blue light casts a **circular** shadow
- Red light casts a **rectangular** shadow

Both statements are true about the shadow, but **truth is the geometry of the cylinder**.

With a third light source, you might discover it's not a cylinder but a wedge (triangular shadow).

**Key Insight**: Intelligence is the aggregation and synthesis of perspectives into a single version of truth about reality.

## Choice vs Decision

### Playing to Win Framework

From the book *Playing to Win* - if you're a finite player, this is your field manual.

**Choice vs Decision**:
- **Decision** implies selecting from options
- **Choice** implies **sacrifice** - intentionally sacrificing suboptimal alternatives

### The Choice Cascade

Most strategy lives in the bottom of this cascade:
1. ~~Winning Aspiration~~ (rarely addressed by CI)
2. ~~Where to Play~~ (rarely addressed by CI)
3. How will we win?
4. What capabilities must be in place?
5. What management systems are required?

**Problem**: Most strategy is misdirected at winning aspirations and decisions about where to play that were made by others who no longer have a stake in the outcome.

## The Anti-Fragile Strategy

### Reconverge Demolition

Three startups went through the "demolition process":
1. Angles of Attack algorithm
2. Determine superiority criteria
3. Determine control factors
4. Reprogram to be **anti-fragile**

**Anti-Fragile**: When encountering stress from the market, the strategy gets **stronger** rather than weaker.

> "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." - Mike Tyson

## Disruption and Innovation

### Peter Drucker's Wisdom

> "You have to look beyond your current business. Your current business will actually mislead you from finding the pathway to the future."

The pathway of the future is populated with people who are **not currently your customers**.

**Primary Mission**: The primary mission of a business is not to return capital to shareholders - it's to **create a customer**.

### How Disruptors Work

1. Look for human jobs that are currently being done
2. Remove humans from the equation
3. Trim cost structure so efficiently it can serve a wider market
4. **Incumbents let them do it**

### Jobs-to-be-Done

Research needs to think about **customer needs** as opposed to **customer wants**. Traditional market research focuses on wants, which isn't helpful when creating a new business that may not yet exist in measurable form.

## The Angles of Attack Framework

### Meeting Clay Christensen

At the 2006 SCIP conference, Clay Christensen (father of disruptive innovation theory) was keynote speaker. His reaction:

> "Boy, you guys are like my tribe. Where have you been all my life? Why have I never heard of you?"

**The Branding Problem**: When people like Clay Christensen say they never knew CI existed, you've got a branding problem.

### Christensen's Problem Statement

> "Big successful companies don't know how much to invest in unproven, less profitable new businesses."

Why? Because those new businesses don't look like they match your brand identity.

### The S-Curve Reality

Disruptive technologies always start out being relatively low quality before climbing the S-curve:
- Low quality → Medium → High → Most demanding use → Subsumed by next technology

**The Problem with Disruption Theory**: It's relatively hopeless - established companies almost always lose due to failure to adjust their attitude.

## The Four Angles of Attack

### Alpha (Market Leaders)

- Leaders of the market
- Continue investing in capabilities that eventually **overshoot** highest quality uses
- Primary performance parameter becomes too expensive/complicated for existing demand

**Example**: Sears in 1970 building the world's tallest skyscraper while Walmart was expanding nationally - a decade of managerial distraction.

### Beta (Value Chain Specialists)

- Specialists enabling cost structure advantages Alphas cannot match
- Alphas willingly surrender marketplace portions to Betas
- By the time Betas reach the sweet spot, Alphas have overshot tremendously

### Gamma (Disruptive Innovators)

- Create new curves by addressing **nascent expectations of demand**
- Needs customers can't even articulate
- Offers not yet good enough to unlock a new Alpha curve

**Example**: iPhone improved upon Android's gamma (removing keys from smartphone). Google responded by funding Android to create a Beta competing with Apple's new Alpha.

### Delta (Category Creators)

- Creation of a new category addressing non-consuming context
- Pure imagination-driven innovation

**Example**: Telepathic communication - until recently pure Delta, now a Gamma with actual thought-broadcasting capability.

### Key Principle

> **Customer expectations (superiority criteria) always grow at a slower rate than your ability to express control factors programmed to meet that superiority criteria.**

---

## Superiority Criteria

### Satisfiers

- Things every market provider must do
- Providers always try to over-deliver
- **Market never rewards over-delivery on satisfiers**
- Beta/Gamma curves exploit Alpha over-delivery

### Drivers

Create temporary advantage rewarded with share. Competitors have three choices:
1. **Imitate** - copy the driver
2. **Leapfrog** - improve upon it
3. **Surrender** - accept inevitable loss

**Surrender is hardest for Alphas**: Sears took 49 years to surrender to Walmart.

### Disruptors

- Attack jobs-for-hire of existing offers
- Make existing offers irrelevant
- Example: BlackBerry's keys became irrelevant when widescreen browsing required removal

## Control Factors (Reinterpreted KITs)

After discussing with Jan Herring (who brought KITs from CIA to Motorola):

| Original KIT | Control Factor | Mission |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Strategic Decisions | Factors You Control | Choices influencing success |
| Early Warning Topics | Factors Nobody Controls | Megatrends, signals of industry change |
| Key Market Players | Factors Others Control (that you might influence) | Competitive confrontations and outcomes |

> "Actionable is really the litmus test for what competitive intelligence is there to do."

## The Infinite Game for CI

**Question**: What's the infinite game for CI?

**Answer**: To become **champions for growth** in the organizations they serve.

- **Skill Set**: 900+ analytical techniques and tools
- **Mindset**: Growth champion orientation

> "If you lack the mindset, it doesn't matter what your skill set is because it will be eliminated with extreme prejudice when the business cycle turns."

---

## Intelligence's Role

### Test, Don't Support

> "Intelligence is there to **test** not support."

Supporting the strategy is actually problematic. Intelligence should figure out what's wrong with it and make it anti-fragile when the marketplace throws curveballs.

### The Rodney Dangerfield Problem

CI as a discipline doesn't get respect. To influence existential organizational strategy, CI needs:
- Credibility (takes 2-5 years to build)
- Reputation attached to growth mission
- Empathy with internal clients' pressures

## Key Takeaways

1. **Humility is prerequisite** for intelligence to have yield
2. **The Stochasm** (gap between perceived and actual knowledge) is where intelligence creates value
3. **Choice implies sacrifice** - deliberately select optimal, sacrifice suboptimal
4. **Anti-fragile strategy** gets stronger under stress
5. **Four Angles of Attack** (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) describe all business evolution
6. **Superiority Criteria** (Satisfiers, Drivers, Disruptors) drive competitive dynamics
7. **Control Factors** make KITs actionable
8. **Growth Champion mindset** is the infinite game for CI

## The Call to Action

> "I want to see 2,000 people at a SCIP conference someday soon."

To achieve this:
- Redefine CI beyond "priesthood of nerds"
- Become influencers of choices contributing to success
- Share the burden of growth executives
- Take a substitutional role in the growth mission

\# Missionary \& Mercenary Concepts

\*Extracted from "The Missionary and The Mercenary"\*



\## Preface



\* \[cite\_start]"In this book, you'll learn that you have two primary mindsets living inside of you - we all do! We call these the Missionary and the Mercenary." \[cite: 83-86]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary is a mindset in which you can see infinite possibilities and are driven by a higher calling you'll seldom take credit for." \[cite: 86-88]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary is a mindset in which possibilities are finite and your winning aspiration will always be defined by a victory based on deliberate action." \[cite: 88]

\* \[cite\_start]"Another way to view these mindsets is as a contrast between idealism and pragmatism." \[cite: 89]

\* \[cite\_start]"The idealist has a single path that guides them into the future. They subvert all of their individual goals against that ideal course of action. And they will tolerate underperformance or even failure if it means staying true to their principles." \[cite: 90-92]

\* \[cite\_start]"The pragmatist employs, with great dexterity, compromise (or even betrayal) to get things done. Mercenaries commonly work in fierce competition with others, whose inability to bend the rules or their own ethics can be used successfully against them." \[cite: 93-94]

\* \[cite\_start]"The problem with the pragmatist is that they're always chasing somebody else's dream. They are the hired gun who produces outcomes others cannot, but they never pursue dreams of their own beyond the next engagement." \[cite: 95-96]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionary and Mercenary, idealist and pragmatist contrasts the other and has its own opportunities and assets, strengths and weaknesses." \[cite: 98]

\* \[cite\_start]"Neither mindset is universally 'best' - when you use each mindset, intentionally adjusting the balance between the two, it becomes possible to take control of every situation to optimize opportunities and outcomes alike." \[cite: 103]

\* \[cite\_start]"Blend implies more of one mindset automatically translates to less of the other. Balance means both mindsets coexist in harmony, just as bass and treble can harmonize disparate voices musically to form a better chord." \[cite: 111-112]

\* \[cite\_start]"Our book is distinct in that it portrays both the Missionary and Mercenary as vital, with both needing to coexist and lead action at appropriate times." \[cite: 127]

\* \[cite\_start]"We recognize that, by learning the strengths and weaknesses we have for both Missionary and Mercenary perspectives, we can converge our talents and skills for a more significant, satisfying, and lasting outcome." \[cite: 138]



\## Section 1: Discovery



\* \[cite\_start]"You will see that each mindset - Missionary and Mercenary - are very different in handling two of the key features of the macro-environment. We call these two features under-certainty and stochasm, and the mindsets are never so far apart as the way in which they each cope with them." \[cite: 304-307]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary, who prioritizes their own victory, does not empathize well with stakeholders beyond their immediate benefactor, the person rewarding them for performance." \[cite: 308]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries can ignore almost all of the uncontrollables the rest of us tend to worry about in the macro-environment to defeat the short list of obstacles standing in the way of success." \[cite: 309]

\* \[cite\_start]"The principal advantage of the Mercenary is using that short inventory to choose how to win during Optimality." \[cite: 310]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary, by contrast, is paralyzed thinking of who will win or lose because they have a higher calling they are always working toward." \[cite: 311]

\* \[cite\_start]"The longer list of uncontrollables is overwhelming to the Missionary because they pursue the ideal for all involved, even at the expense of maximizing their own success or satisfaction." \[cite: 312]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary eventually must learn from the Mercenary how to ignore almost all of those uncontrollables to get anything done." \[cite: 313]

\* \[cite\_start]"By complementing each other's strengths and mitigating each other's weaknesses, the Missionary and the Mercenary give themselves the best chance to survive the forces that threaten their shared mission." \[cite: 315]



\## Chapter 1: Under-Certainty



\* \[cite\_start]"Uncertainty... Prevents the Missionary from acting without limiting their scope to the finite and knowable" \[cite: 346-348]

\* \[cite\_start]"Under-Certainty... Empowers the Mercenary with advantages for decisive action and predictable results" \[cite: 352-355]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries tend to analyze probability further by splitting it into imminence and certainty, which provides a third dimension to give a higher-resolution understanding of the real uncontrollables they'll need to cope with and survive." \[cite: 402]

\* \[cite\_start]"Because the Missionary sees strategy as existential instead of executable, most strategies are shockingly frail." \[cite: 512]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary sees things differently - a plan that might fail is not a plan at all. To paraphrase General Patton, Mercenaries understand that no plan will survive engagement with the enemy." \[cite: 513-514]

\* \[cite\_start]"Both the Missionary and Mercenary are open to possibility and have a sense of service they are called into. They're both uncompromising and work towards their highest calling (summa vocació) or a great calling (magna vocació)." \[cite: 621-622]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary looks at possibility through the belief that there is only one way - THE WAY. The way has constraints on it (how you treat others, what you're willing to do or not do, etc.), which precludes a large proportion of the possibilities available because they would contradict their calling." \[cite: 628-629]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary's perspective on under-certainty would be that it's impossible to know the infinite and all the possibilities that might happen as the future unfolds." \[cite: 630]

\* \[cite\_start]"They play to keep playing, which is the mindset of an infinite game." \[cite: 633]

\* \[cite\_start]"They won't compromise their mission, but they bend their own will, emotions, and ideas to the path being revealed and directed for them." \[cite: 634]

\* \[cite\_start]"When the Mercenary considers possibilities, there isn't just one way. They're unencumbered by constraints directed by some higher power. They must succeed at a single assignment that produces a desired outcome for themselves and their benefactor." \[cite: 635-636]

\* \[cite\_start]"Producing a result depends on intentionally limiting their scope of action by defeating the few under-certainties standing in their way." \[cite: 638]

\* \[cite\_start]"Their finite mindset is only concerned with playing to win the game." \[cite: 639]

\* \[cite\_start]"They are uncompromising in producing results, but will compromise on which path they take to reach the finish line." \[cite: 640]

\* \[cite\_start]"The mindset of the Missionary is unthinkable to the Mercenary and vice versa." \[cite: 641]

\* \[cite\_start]"But neither your Mercenary nor Missionary is a villain. They're both heroes of your own story. They work in tandem to shape you and, by extension, your teammates into a more successful and higher-performing version of who you really are." \[cite: 642-644]

\* \[cite\_start]"While your Mercenary is naturally at ease defeating a limited list of under-certainties constraining forward progress, your Missionary will be called upon in the necessary next step in Discovery." \[cite: 722]



\## Chapter 2: Stochasm



\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenary stakeholders will ignore or fight those who contradict them, but Missionaries will seek out conflicting opinions to reveal the whole truth." \[cite: 761]

\* \[cite\_start]"To the Mercenary, the universe and everything in it is disorderly - even random." \[cite: 787]

\* \[cite\_start]"It is unthinkable to the Mercenary that a stochasm exists at all because they assume their short list of under-certainties must have accounted for anything important." \[cite: 788]

\* \[cite\_start]"It's easier on their ego for them to add to what they already know than it is for them to accept their beliefs were wrong." \[cite: 789]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary also doesn't prioritize leaving behind an improved state of affairs for others. They care most about getting rewarded for a job well done that produces a desired result for their client." \[cite: 790-791]

\* \[cite\_start]"Sometimes, they're even forced to accept falsehoods to survive the moral cost of their actions, including the lie that they have no responsibility to consider their long-term impact on the world at large." \[cite: 792]

\* \[cite\_start]"Most business leaders lean toward Mercenary in their mindset, but this tendency is not limited to commercial matters." \[cite: 793]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary, on the other hand, sees where others are encumbered by faulty assumptions designed to boost their ego. Confronting and correcting those lies replaces misconceptions with clear, complete, and accurate truth." \[cite: 798-799]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary must leave behind conditions improved from those that existed before they were involved by honestly parsing fact from fiction." \[cite: 801]

\* \[cite\_start]"Just as the Mercenary is adept at defeating finite under-certainties, the Missionary thrives while confronting untruths one at a time, wherever they arise." \[cite: 802]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary questions: What is truth? The Missionary answers: Truth is simply facts in harmony with reality." \[cite: 803-804]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary helps others gain the perspective they're missing to achieve a higher-resolution understanding of their shared reality." \[cite: 828]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary does not lack the ability to see the stochasms of others. In fact, they will exploit such knowledge gaps to win." \[cite: 829-832]

\* \[cite\_start]"By contrast, the Missionary will never find justice being rewarded for a job well done when everyone else suffers the consequences. The ends never justify the means. Missionaries have a moral advantage over amoral Mercenaries since Missionaries cannot operate on false beliefs." \[cite: 833-834]

\* \[cite\_start]"They must reconcile contradictions to take advantage of life's paradoxes in service to the higher calling of an infinite universe." \[cite: 835]

\* \[cite\_start]"In business, the Missionary's search for truth and commitment to refine the resolution of reality protects a Mercenary's ability to compete over time." \[cite: 837]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionary dedication to their perfect vision of the future precedes Mercenary success in executing the strategy to achieve it." \[cite: 838]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenary bias had clouded leadership's ability to see how the company's dominant market position might ever be threatened." \[cite: 864]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries understand they're better equipped to escape oblivion by admitting they don't know as much as they thought they knew." \[cite: 882]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary advantage in closing a stochasm will always serve long-term sustainability better than the Mercenary's focus on short-term results." \[cite: 888-890]

\* \[cite\_start]"Unlike the Mercenary's winning aspiration, the Missionary serves a just cause. The most contrasting aspect of a just cause is that it is unlikely to be achievable in the Missionary's lifetime. So, they won't benefit directly from their contributions to its progress." \[cite: 892-894]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary, in comparison, prefers a winning aspiration that temporarily rewards them for a job well done. After all, nothing is eternal to them." \[cite: 899-900]

\* \[cite\_start]"To the Mercenary, people are more often obstacles than opportunities. If someone is in their way, they will ignore or neutralize that person so they can stay focused on results. That's why they usually prefer to work alone." \[cite: 902-904]

\* \[cite\_start]"When you lead with your Missionary, your teammates follow because they cannot lead themselves as confidently as you can." \[cite: 963]



\## Chapter 3: Control



\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary accepts the impermanence of life but believes there's an eternity ahead. They don't seek control over others because they surrender dominion to a higher power. Unsolved mysteries don't bother them because their whole universe consists of mysteries." \[cite: 1126-1128]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary, however, isn't so sure there's anything beyond today. Consequently, a much greater sense of control is necessary for them." \[cite: 1129-1130]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mysteries are problematic because they interrupt their focus on getting things done. Unsolved mysteries stand in the way of controlling outcomes and are to be avoided at all costs." \[cite: 1131-1132]

\* \[cite\_start]"As discussed in Chapter 2: Stochasm, the Mercenary is focused on producing a specific result, largely because they do not have the long-term, infinite worldview that the Missionary does." \[cite: 1268]

\* \[cite\_start]"To the Missionary, however, the Mercenary's approach of using control to their own ends seems selfish." \[cite: 1271]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries do not recognize that they always influence others, often accidentally and with unpredictable results." \[cite: 1272]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary is at an advantage in the arena of control because they can help the Missionary understand that, if control is not deliberate or intentional, the results produced are inconsistent, random, and unreliable." \[cite: 1273]



\## Section 2: Optimality



\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary embodies the industrial psychology of the first growth curve, which we call the 'Alpha.'" \[cite: 1510]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary seeks to penetrate the defenses of the market's incumbent actors and represents the disruptor mindset." \[cite: 1512]

\* \[cite\_start]"In the duality popularized by Simon Sinek, they're playing to keep playing against an oligopoly of incumbents who are playing to win." \[cite: 1513]

\* \[cite\_start]"Because Optimality begins with the advantage of disruption and ends with humility, the Missionary, somewhat ironically, has the advantage." \[cite: 1516]

\* \[cite\_start]"Only during Superiority can the Mercenary course-correct their offer to prevent erosion of their market share, which the Missionary mindset is programmed to pursue." \[cite: 1517]



\## Chapter 4: Disruption



\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary represents the pragmatic industrial psychology of the protector defending their territory. The Missionary represents the idealistic disruptor who seeks a better outcome for the buyer." \[cite: 1557-1558]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries are all about winning zero-sum games, but that is seldom how disruption unfolds." \[cite: 1890]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries play to win; Missionaries play to keep playing." \[cite: 1890-1891]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries understand profit is a byproduct of innovation, not its primary purpose." \[cite: 1893]

\* \[cite\_start]"While Stage 1 of the new S-curve requires a Missionary mindset to accept the meager profit incentives motivating the innovator, the Mercenary quickly takes over when the new offer proves to have traction with a defensible target market segment in Stage 2." \[cite: 1917]

\* \[cite\_start]"Because you seldom turn a profit in Stage 1, Mercenaries aren't interested in disruptive new Gammas." \[cite: 1917]

\* \[cite\_start]"However, when buyers begin to demonstrate how the faster growing new offer can achieve Alpha during Stage 2, the Mercenary wakes up and seizes control." \[cite: 1918]

\* \[cite\_start]"By the time you reach Stage 3, the Mercenary is fully in charge, and saturation down-market with competing Betas is the path to future market dominance, as Apple did with the iPhone." \[cite: 1919]

\* \[cite\_start]"A Mercenary would never disrupt smartphones with a widescreen iPod; they'd simply make a better BlackBerry." \[cite: 1920]

\* \[cite\_start]"While the advantage of the Missionary quickly turns Mercenary to exploit the profit motive, the Mercenary seldom starts with a disruptive offer in the first place." \[cite: 1921]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary exemplifies the industrial psychology of the Alpha, which is to defend its existing market share from incursion by other Alphas." \[cite: 1922]

\* \[cite\_start]"If your work supports a Gamma disruptor, you will need teammates and stakeholders alike to accept the Missionary's meager profit incentives required to sustain Stage 1. However, once they see the potential for market dominance emerge in Stage 2, your job will become easier as you support their Mercenary instincts." \[cite: 1927]

\* \[cite\_start]"As your Stage 3 Gamma takes market share away from the Alphas and Betas who previously owned it, your Missionary must continue to look out for new disruptors of your own." \[cite: 1929]



\## Chapter 5: Superiority



\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries are great at competing on satisfiers and drivers. But they generally struggle when competing on disruptors." \[cite: 2328-2329]

\* \[cite\_start]"They're more concerned with gaining the immediate financial rewards of taking share from someone else than they are experimenting with creating new markets where no prior signals indicate a market exists." \[cite: 2329]

\* \[cite\_start]"Do you think of yourself as the Mercenary Alpha or Beta taking share from other Mercenaries? Or, are you the Missionary Gamma or Delta creating new markets and making incumbents irrelevant?" \[cite: 2339-2340]

\* \[cite\_start]"A Missionary mindset can eventually win the war for market share, but you'll require a Mercenary CEO to do it." \[cite: 2343]

\* \[cite\_start]"To build his vision and expand the company, Schultz was the perfect Mercenary. He sought out locations with greater traffic potential and joined forces with other established Alphas in adjacent markets." \[cite: 2350-2351]

\* \[cite\_start]"However, Schultz's Mercenary instincts focused on financial performance and taking share everywhere Starbucks opened a store." \[cite: 2353]

\* \[cite\_start]"Schultz's Mercenary consented to the Missionary innovation that would restart Starbucks' growth." \[cite: 2357]

\* \[cite\_start]"While patience in creating the Third Place might be Starbucks' most Missionary characteristic, the Mercenary alone consents to the market's definition of satisfiers and drivers." \[cite: 2361]

\* \[cite\_start]"The next time you see a Starbucks Siren, notice her two tails and remember the Missionary and Mercenary mindsets she represents." \[cite: 2365]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary will tempt you to focus on immediate, practical priorities for you and the other stakeholders involved." \[cite: 2391]

\* \[cite\_start]"Let your Missionary gain an appreciation for others' superiority criteria to reveal potential disruptors." \[cite: 2394]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary expects no quid pro quo like the Mercenary would. The Missionary serves a higher calling." \[cite: 2395-2396]



\## Chapter 6: Humility



\* \[cite\_start]"While Missionaries have an advantage in making people more teachable, the Mercenary uses humility as a weapon against narcissists." \[cite: 2536]

\* \[cite\_start]"You'll learn how Missionary and Mercenary mindsets differentiate true from false confidence." \[cite: 2533]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Missionary puts others first and relies on the opinion of a higher power for self-esteem. But your Mercenary is just as free of the opinions of others - they're more often in the way of reaching your objective." \[cite: 2755-2756]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Missionary might wish someone was less arrogant than they truly are so they'll be easier to get along with. But your Mercenary will use an enemy's narcissism for more practical purposes." \[cite: 2759-2760]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary's exploitation of an enemy's toxic arrogance can be almost as effective as your Missionary's use of humility to befriend an ally." \[cite: 2761]

\* \[cite\_start]"Since your Missionary assumes the best of everyone, your Mercenary will need to be on the lookout." \[cite: 2767]

\* \[cite\_start]"It's tempting to assume all Mercenary traits are narcissistic in this way, but exploitation isn't the Mercenary's gift." \[cite: 2768]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary is usually better at identifying a narcissistic personality than your Missionary because their pragmatism isn't as offended by its presence." \[cite: 2770]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary is merely protecting your interests from exploitation by others and might even be curious about how to use the weaknesses of a nearby narcissist to your advantage." \[cite: 2771]

\* \[cite\_start]"To a Mercenary, there's nothing wrong with feigning humility if pretending makes winning more likely." \[cite: 2772]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary ideal of putting others first and oneself last is seductive to those who might not have experience with manipulation of that sort." \[cite: 2774]

\* \[cite\_start]"In the Mercenary pursuit of growing an audience, creators subvert their own higher calling to drive clicks with content tailored to appeal to specific viewers." \[cite: 2777]

\* \[cite\_start]"Narcissists tend to prey on Missionaries until a Mercenary steps in. Our recommendations blend your Missionary and Mercenary mindsets." \[cite: 2797]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Missionary might be patient, loving, and willing to teach the narcissist, seeing their humanity and wanting them to recover. But your Mercenary will not tolerate the narcissist's games more than once and is willing to cut them from the team to ensure their own goals are met." \[cite: 2798-2799]

\* \[cite\_start]"As a result of the Mercenary advantage in dealing with arrogant teammates, it's tempting to despair that only Mercenaries can succeed in modern corporations today." \[cite: 2800]

\* \[cite\_start]"But authentic Missionary leaders create lasting enterprises that can outlive them without losing sight of the higher calling they've committed to serve." \[cite: 2801]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries must have their Mercenary on the lookout for the unhumble and arrogant, or risk letting them destroy everything the team is working towards." \[cite: 2802]

\* \[cite\_start]"Instead, let your Mercenary either use the friction they create to make progress more quickly or cut them off entirely, even when your Missionary can't or won't." \[cite: 2803]

\* \[cite\_start]"Which comes more naturally to you? To be the Mercenary who causes heads to roll at the first sign of narcissism? Or, to be the Missionary who puts everyone else ahead of your own self-interest?" \[cite: 2804-2805]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary mindset uses humility to be more teachable than their enemies, but the Mercenary guards against the hidden effects of having a fox in the hen house." \[cite: 2910]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary will get distracted by their overwhelming drive to win but will be able to recognize those traits in others and imagine how nefarious their actions could become, if left unchecked. Your Missionary, on the other hand, reminds you of the values that make winning worthwhile in the first place." \[cite: 2924-2925]

\* \[cite\_start]"As you'll learn in the next chapter, we'd all prefer the Missionary's humility to drive our collaboration with others. But the arrogant among us tend to render themselves so willfully helpless that we have no choice but to notch another arrow from the Mercenary's quiver - guile." \[cite: 2929-2930]



\## Section 3: Simulation



\* \[cite\_start]"The principal task for both Missionary and Mercenary during Simulation is to understand how to best influence the stakeholders involved." \[cite: 2983]

\* \[cite\_start]"Both mindsets must present a friendly face, but the Missionary and Mercenary need not agree on when the use of guile is justified." \[cite: 2986]

\* \[cite\_start]"They both use empathy, but one produces kindness and the other uses it as a weapon." \[cite: 2987]



\## Chapter 7: Guile



\* \[cite\_start]"Guile is critical to the simulation of a successful IGC so your Missionary can attract helpful friends while your Mercenary baffles your hostile foes." \[cite: 3012]

\* \[cite\_start]"You'll learn how motion pictures like Duplicity and The Equalizer dramatize how Missionaries and Mercenaries balance guile the same way disruptive innovators do, including Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA." \[cite: 3013]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Mercenary is able to use guile more effectively than the Missionary can. This is because the Mercenary must routinely conceal their motivations to be successful, particularly from a potentially hostile opponent or obstacle." \[cite: 3043-3044]

\* \[cite\_start]"They must present a more neutral face to those stakeholders who stand to lose if they succeed. This two-facedness can be described with one word: duplicity." \[cite: 3045-3046]

\* \[cite\_start]"Likewise, an experienced Missionary will also realize they must compassionately use duplicity from time to time." \[cite: 3047]

\* \[cite\_start]"This is especially true when Missionaries are trying to help someone sacrifice attractive options, which are suboptimal in the near term, while pursuing a long-term result." \[cite: 3048]

\* \[cite\_start]"While Missionaries use empathy as an allusory instrument for attracting business partners, Mercenaries use guile as an illusory tool to confuse their competitors." \[cite: 3055]

\* \[cite\_start]"The corporate 'immune system' present in P1 is a largely Missionary mindset doing its best to empathize with partners instead of beguiling potential rivals." \[cite: 3116-3117]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries make peace differently than Missionaries do. Mercenaries end the fight by any means necessary. Missionaries, on the other hand, extend the olive branch... usually sacrificing something to negotiate an end to hostilities." \[cite: 3283-3284]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary must only beguile to discipline someone into staying on the straight and narrow path. By contrast, the Mercenary expects a return on the guile they've invested in." \[cite: 3311-3312]

\* \[cite\_start]"They feel free to mislead hostiles if it produces a better outcome. Guile is permissible to Mercenaries whether or not it helps to restore justice or fairness, as long as they personally gain." \[cite: 3312-3313]

\* \[cite\_start]"Like the Missionary, the Mercenary seeks to know friends and foes better than they know themselves." \[cite: 3314]

\* \[cite\_start]"In the process, the Mercenary equips their client to optimize choices they might not even know exist with tools and techniques to become unstoppable." \[cite: 3315]

\* \[cite\_start]"You must balance your Missionary and Mercenary mindsets to seduce or baffle those you seek to serve and at whose expense that service is rendered." \[cite: 3316]

\* \[cite\_start]"Although your Missionary will be content to surrender results to the will of their higher power, your impatient Mercenary will demand a strategy tested to reveal its frailties or risk it leading to failure." \[cite: 3317]



\## Chapter 8: Empathy



\* \[cite\_start]"Your Missionary and Mercenary have very different emotional responses to the plight of others. Missionaries default to sympathy, while Mercenaries tend toward apathy." \[cite: 3512-3513]

\* \[cite\_start]"A Missionary doesn't need to have undergone similar struggles to feel compassion for another and want to help. But a Mercenary generally feels little urgency to assist unless they've come through something similar." \[cite: 3513-3514]

\* \[cite\_start]"The intellectual recognition of another's circumstances is where empathy — compassion to help plus the urgency to act — unites your Missionary and Mercenary to do things neither one can do alone." \[cite: 3515]

\* \[cite\_start]"Lacking this rationalization of empathy with other stakeholders, your Missionary and Mercenary will continue to conflict emotionally between sympathy and apathy." \[cite: 3531]

\* \[cite\_start]"Sometimes, a Mercenary perspective can empathize far better than a Missionary can." \[cite: 3764]

\* \[cite\_start]"As a moral idealist, a Missionary serves a just cause that will seldom be achieved in their lifetime. For them, progress toward achieving that just cause is the goal, not a win ending in personal or team success." \[cite: 3792-3793]

\* \[cite\_start]"A Mercenary, by contrast, is the amoral pragmatist with a winning aspiration and the need to achieve more immediate objectives. They define success as the ending of an engagement having achieved a here-and-now result." \[cite: 3794-3795]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries use empathy to help others get what they want while making progress toward the ideal, while Mercenaries use empathy to maneuver friends and foes alike to respond in predictable ways that enable their pragmatic win." \[cite: 3796]

\* \[cite\_start]"Our Missionary and Mercenary have never been more similar than in their use of empathy to influence others by motivation and incentives to collaborate." \[cite: 3797]

\* \[cite\_start]"Your Mercenary will exploit their desire to express their gift or ability in exchange for benefits they would enjoy in return — praise or a paycheck, for example." \[cite: 3800-3801]

\* \[cite\_start]"On the other hand, the Missionary would help them feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves and that we are working towards the greater good." \[cite: 3802]

\* \[cite\_start]"Most of the clients we work with have no shortage of this Missionary mindset available. They tend to lack, however, the Mercenary mindset of emotional indifference to the trials and tribulations they might encounter." \[cite: 3885-3886]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries require recognition of their own past experiences to make empathy a rational response." \[cite: 3889]

\* \[cite\_start]"For your Missionary, that hope is divinely inspired and directed. For your Mercenary, it's simply utilitarian for the greatest number of stakeholders." \[cite: 3942-3943]



\## Chapter 9: Actionable



\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries will hesitate to take action unless the action serves their just cause. Pragmatic Mercenaries, who have a lower threshold to action because the ends justify the means, are unencumbered with this idealism." \[cite: 3988-3989]

\* \[cite\_start]"Consensus is ideal, but Missionaries tend to be slower to achieve such agreement by all." \[cite: 4084]

\* \[cite\_start]"Consent is more pragmatic, and Mercenaries are comfortable letting influential stakeholders grumble along at the risk of being left behind." \[cite: 4085]

\* \[cite\_start]"Innovators are Missionary about their yet-unproven ideas and believe in the just cause they serve. They hope to get everyone on board since consensus validates the just cause and makes it easier to achieve before profits can incentivize effort." \[cite: 4188-4190]

\* \[cite\_start]"But Mercenary financiers believe that consensus is unnecessary. If they see someone foot-dragging, they're more than happy to kick the saboteur off the bus so they don't slow everyone else down in pursuit of success. All they're seeking is consent." \[cite: 4192-4193]

\* \[cite\_start]"Both Missionary and Mercenary have under-certainties they must defeat before they choose how to act. Both must then adapt those actions as conditions change in their macro-environment." \[cite: 4193-4194]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries use empathy and guile to energize others to confidently pursue an actionable esteem they created together." \[cite: 4331]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries are driven by the desire for an immediate win." \[cite: 4332]

\* \[cite\_start]"Because action yields results, Mercenaries seek consent rather than consensus with less hesitancy to act than Missionaries do." \[cite: 4333]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries understand that what counts is never who will let them, but who can stop them. That slight advantage in pursuit of winning aspirations gives Mercenaries an actionable edge." \[cite: 4336-4337]

\* \[cite\_start]"The contemplative friction of your conscience must decide whether your actions should be pragmatic or idealistic. This contemplation reflects that your Missionary and Mercenary are in a constant state of tension." \[cite: 4351-4352]

\* \[cite\_start]"Measurement of quantitative, concrete, or 'hard' KPIs... is easier for the Mercenary, who plays to win and values methods that prove they've achieved the short-term gain they promised." \[cite: 4363]

\* \[cite\_start]"The Missionary appreciates the often-dismissed value of anecdotal, hard-to-define measures of influence." \[cite: 4366]

\* \[cite\_start]"Incorporating qualitative, abstract, or 'soft' KPIs... is non-negotiable when your stakeholders have a more Missionary vision that might require decades to achieve and only on someone else's watch." \[cite: 4369-4370]

\* \[cite\_start]"Mercenaries are particularly good at translating features into benefits because they are so driven by the need for a win." \[cite: 4380]

\* \[cite\_start]"Missionaries don't tend to make very good salespeople as a result, but they're great marketers." \[cite: 4382]

\* \[cite\_start]"Taking too long or not taking long enough can put success at risk, which means that neither the Mercenary nor Missionary mindset can be permitted to dominate the other." \[cite: 4389]

\* \[cite\_start]"Action is based on confidence, and the confidence to act is the principal yield of a well-balanced Missionary + Mercenary mindset." \[cite: 4398]



\## Chapter X: Champion



\* \[cite\_start]"Insatiable curiosity is a squarely Missionary value, as much as worthy challenge is a Mercenary one." \[cite: 5033]

\* \[cite\_start]"Authentic selflessness is a shared sense of purpose that something bigger than we are matters more than we do. This is the common ground that equips Missionary + Mercenary to both work seamlessly together while still individually pursuing their great and highest callings." \[cite: 5034-5035]

\* \[cite\_start]"Stakeholders unable or unwilling to get results for themselves must have faith in their champion's Mercenary abilities to entrust that the champion will achieve the collectively desired outcome." \[cite: 4737]

\* \[cite\_start]"Yet, those results manifest largely because the champion's Missionary has enough faith in the justness of the cause to do something worthwhile. In this way, the pragmatic serves the idyllic." \[cite: 4738-4739]

\* \[cite\_start]"In truth, Peter Bailey's Missionary lacked the Mercenary instincts to succeed in business, while Potter's Mercenary lacked the Missionary heart for reaching out to others. Both men were too extreme in their commitment to their own nature." \[cite: 4781-4782]

\* \[cite\_start]"Like Spartacus and his rebellious slave army, your Missionary + Mercenary must champion each other. Each must be willing to sacrifice to preserve the other." \[cite: 4972-4973]

\* \[cite\_start]"To keep his fellow slaves free, Spartacus' Mercenary was willing to fight, kill, die, or do whatever was necessary." \[cite: 4974]

\* \[cite\_start]"Likewise, his Missionary modeled sacrifice for those he loved by putting his own interests after theirs." \[cite: 4975]

\* \[cite\_start]"If your Missionary doesn't prioritize, it's all too easy to burn out as we fight against forces we can't control." \[cite: 4943]

We know it can be hard to see trials that way when you're still in moments of crisis. But we want you to live a life where any opportunity to flex your newfound Missionary + Mercenary leaves you hopeful rather than fearful." \[cite: 5172-5174]

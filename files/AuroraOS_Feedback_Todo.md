# AuroraOS.html Copy Revision Todo List

> Focus: Strengthening "Actionability" messaging and correcting competitive positioning

## Critical Framing Correction

**The current HTML conflates two different concepts that must be separated:**

1. **The Proliferation Model (Agile)** - How SuperCycle will spread as an industry standard
2. **The Competitive Enemy (Traditional Strategic Planning)** - What SuperCycle replaces

**Key Analogy:**
> Agile : Waterfall (project management) :: SuperCycle : Traditional Strategy (strategic planning)

The HTML currently uses "Waterfall" language, which is **project management** terminology. SuperCycle is an **intelligence operating system** that counters **traditional business strategy development**, not project management.

---

## Strategic Context

**From Industry Report - The Real Enemy:**
> "The prevailing 'Waterfall' methodology rests on a fatal fallacy: that the external environment remains stable during execution. This leads to 'Zombie Strategy' - executing plans no longer aligned with market reality."

**The SuperCycle counters:**
- Annual Strategic Planning cycles
- Executive retreat-driven strategy
- HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) decision-making
- Analysis paralysis
- Static "Strategic Plan" documents
- Consultant-delivered strategy (McKinsey model)

**NOT:**
- Waterfall project management
- Software development methodologies

## Copy Revision Tasks

### 1. Hero Section - Fix Competitive Positioning

**Current Copy (lines 113-115):**
> "We are replacing static 'Waterfall' strategy with the Aurora SuperCycle—a continuous loop of finding Truth, making Choices, and Testing outcomes."

**Problem:** Uses "Waterfall" which is project management terminology.

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Replace "Waterfall strategy" with "Annual Strategic Planning" or "Traditional Strategy"
- [ ] Emphasize the intelligence/decision-making angle, not project management
- [ ] Frame as delivering "investment-grade decisions" for executives

**Suggested revision:**
> "We are replacing static Annual Strategic Planning with the Aurora SuperCycle—a continuous intelligence operating system that delivers actionable strategy, not shelf-ware plans."

---

### 2. Hero Section - Update Comparison Cards

**Current Copy (lines 117-126):**
> Old Way: "Waterfall Planning"
> New Way: "The SuperCycle"

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Replace "Waterfall Planning" with "Annual Strategic Planning" or "Traditional Strategy"
- [ ] Consider adding descriptive contrast:
  - Old: "Annual Strategic Plan" → "Static, obsolete upon printing"
  - New: "SuperCycle Intelligence" → "Dynamic, continuously validated"

---

### 3. Discovery Section - Emphasize Actionable Intelligence

**Current Copy (line 184-186):**
> "The Discovery phase focuses on 'Contingency Factors'—uncontrollable external forces. We use the STEEPLED framework to scan the macro-environment and produce 'The LIST'."

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Add copy explaining that The LIST is not just information but **actionable intelligence**
- [ ] Emphasize weak signal detection that triggers **action** before competitors see it
- [ ] Reference the "Stochasm Meter" concept - quantified certainty gaps that demand action

**Suggested additions:**
- "Early warning triggers that demand immediate attention"
- "Prioritized intelligence, not information overload"

---

### 4. Optimality Section - Strengthen Decision-Making Language

**Current Copy (lines 223-225):**
> "Optimality hardens 'Dominion Factors'—the things we can control. Here, we move from broad possibilities to a specific Investment Grade Conjecture (IGC)."

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Emphasize that IGC is a **decision artifact** not a planning document
- [ ] Add language about "sacrifice" - what you choose NOT to do is actionable strategy
- [ ] Clarify that this phase produces **choices to execute**, not options to consider

**Reference copy from Industry Report:**
- "Strategy is what you choose NOT to do"
- The Sacrifice Matrix "forces explicit sacrifice when making choices"

---

### 5. Simulation Section - Clarify "Actionable Esteem" Output

**Current Copy (lines 282-284):**
> "Simulation hardens 'Influence Factors'—how stakeholders will react. We don't guess; we wargame. The output is Actionable Esteem: a scientifically validated probability of success."

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Expand explanation of "Actionable Esteem" - this is the key differentiator
- [ ] Emphasize it's probability-scored, not gut-feel
- [ ] Add the "Martian Protocol" concept - step-by-step logic chain explaining why strategy will succeed
- [ ] Frame output as "decision confidence" that enables executives to act

**Suggested language:**
- "Know your probability of success before you commit resources"
- "Remove magic and luck from strategic decisions"
- "Wargamed validation, not executive consensus (HiPPO)"

---

### 6. Rituals Section - Fix "Waterfall" Reference

**Current Copy (lines 397-399):**
> "Unlike Waterfall's annual retreats, the SuperCycle is alive."

**Problem:** "Waterfall's annual retreats" conflates project management with strategic planning retreats.

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Replace "Waterfall's annual retreats" with "annual strategy retreats" or "traditional annual planning cycles"
- [ ] Reframe rituals as **decision points** not just meetings
- [ ] Emphasize each ritual produces an **action** or **decision**

**Suggested revision:**
> "Unlike annual strategy off-sites that produce shelf-ware, the SuperCycle is alive."

**Add outcomes to each ritual:**
- Daily LIST Check → "Triggers immediate response when weak signals emerge"
- Optimality Orbit → "Recalibrates investment decisions bi-weekly"
- Simulation Pressure Test → "Validates or invalidates strategy quarterly"
- Stochasm Swarm → "Halts execution when reality diverges from plan"

---

### 7. Footer CTA - Drive Action

**Current Copy (lines 462-464):**
> "Ready to enter the SuperCycle? Move from 'Planning' to 'Intelligence'. Build your Squad. Harden your Factors."

**Requested Changes:**
- [ ] Strengthen CTA with actionable language
- [ ] Suggested direction: "Stop planning. Start deciding."
- [ ] Consider adding: "Get actionable intelligence, not more analysis"
- [ ] Update copyright year from 2024 to 2025

## Global Search & Replace Tasks

### Remove/Replace "Waterfall" References

| Find | Replace With | Context |
|------|--------------|---------|
| "Waterfall" | "Traditional Strategy" or "Annual Planning" | General references |
| "Waterfall Planning" | "Annual Strategic Planning" | Comparison sections |
| "Waterfall's annual retreats" | "annual strategy off-sites" | Rituals section |

### Strengthen Actionability Language

| Find | Replace With | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|
| "produces" | "delivers" | More active, output-focused |
| "tracks" | "triggers" | Emphasizes action |
| "hardens" | "converts into actionable" | Clearer business value |
| "scan the macro-environment" | "detect early warning signals" | More urgent |

---

## Global Copy Principles

Apply these principles throughout the document:

1. **Correct the competitive frame**
   - Enemy = Traditional Strategic Planning, Annual Plans, HiPPO decisions
   - NOT = Waterfall project management

2. **Replace passive language with action verbs**
   - "produces" → "delivers"
   - "tracks" → "triggers"
   - "hardens" → "converts into decisions"

3. **Emphasize outputs over process**
   - Don't just describe what the system does
   - Describe what decision-makers can DO with the output

4. **Address decision-maker pain directly**
   - Analysis paralysis → Actionable Esteem
   - HiPPO decisions → Investment Grade Conjecture
   - Stale annual plans → Dynamic Recalibration

5. **Use Industry Report terminology consistently**
   - Stochasm (the gap between perception and reality)
   - Investment Grade Conjecture (not "strategic plan")
   - Actionable Esteem (not "recommendations")
   - Ground Truth (not "market research")
   - Zombie Strategy (executing obsolete plans)

| **Zombie Strategy** | Executing plans no longer aligned with reality | What traditional planning produces |
| **HiPPO** | Highest Paid Person's Opinion | What IGC replaces |

---

## Reference: Competitive Positioning (From Industry Report)

| vs. | Differentiation |
|-----|-----------------|
| Traditional SPM (Planview, Clarity) | Aurora focuses on strategic choice/intelligence; sits above project execution |
| Threat Intel (Palantir, Recorded Future) | Aurora applies rigor to commercial opportunities, not just security |
| Management Consulting (McKinsey, Bain) | Consultants sell fish; Aurora sells the fishing rod |
| **Annual Strategic Planning** | Static documents vs. living intelligence system |

---

## Summary of Key Changes

1. **Replace all "Waterfall" references** with "Traditional Strategy" / "Annual Planning"
2. **Strengthen actionability language** throughout - focus on what decision-makers can DO
3. **Add "Actionable Esteem" explanation** - this is the key differentiator
4. **Frame rituals as decision cadences** - not meetings, but action triggers
5. **Update footer** - year and stronger CTA

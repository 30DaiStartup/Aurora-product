# The Discovery Process: LIST Model Guide

## Overview

The Discovery Process is a strategic methodology to surface high-leverage insights from complex environments. It is grounded in **LIST**: Landscape, Issues, Stakeholders, and Trends.

The process begins with the **Narrative Estimate** - a hypothesis about the future or current situation that guides exploration.

**Process Flow:**
```
Narrative Estimate → Landscape → Issues → Stakeholders → Trends
```

Each element feeds the next. When complete, you have a model of the environment capable of revealing high-value market segments or opportunities.

## STEP 1: Narrative Estimate (The Hypothesis)

### Definition

A **Narrative Estimate** is a speculative but directionally plausible statement about reality that initiates a strategic discovery process. It:

- Is hypothetical, often fantastical but plausible
- Proposes a compelling "what if" scenario
- Catalyzes exploration into emerging markets, stakeholder dynamics, and uncontrollable forces
- Acts as the cornerstone input to the discovery phase
- Often includes a **miraculous assumption** - an inflection point not yet proven but crucial

> Think of it as rewriting The Hobbit as The Martian - still storytelling, but grounded in science and feasibility rather than magic.

### How to Create a Narrative Estimate

1. **Start with Imagination, Not Evidence**
   - Be bold and imaginative
   - Can defy conventional wisdom
   - Must suggest a reality that could theoretically exist without magic

2. **Frame it as a Miracle Statement**
   - Describes a future state depending on currently unexplained or unpredictable shift
   - Think of it as a "then a miracle occurs" moment used to spark inquiry

3. **Label the Landscape**
   - Give the narrative a name (becomes the "L" in LIST)
   - Like the title of a PowerPoint - brief, broad, suggestive
   - Example: "The Global Margin Call"

4. **Let It Define What Comes Next**
   - Shapes what issues are considered relevant
   - Those issues reveal stakeholders and trends
   - Ultimately informs market segment selection

5. **Expect to Iterate**
   - This is a functional model, not a one-off idea
   - Refine as you explore stakeholders and trends

### Prompt Templates
- What must become true for this opportunity to be real?
- Describe a world, based on this signal, where everything changes.
- What miracle enables this vision?

## STEP 2: Landscape (The Arena)

### Definition

A **Landscape** is a named frame of reference that defines the boundaries of a discovery inquiry. It is:

- The thematic domain for analyzing issues, stakeholders, and trends
- Like the title slide of a PowerPoint deck
- Derived from the Narrative Estimate
- The entry point into structured analysis

> It's not the content itself - it's the label that tells you what kind of content to expect.

### How to Create a Landscape

1. **Name the World You Want to Explore**
   - Give the narrative estimate a succinct title capturing its essence
   - Should be evocative, thematic, and forward-facing
   - Broad enough for multiple issues, specific enough for focused inquiry
   - Example: From global debt collapse narrative → "The Global Margin Call"

2. **Keep It Conceptual, Not Operational**
   - Should NOT describe a solution, product, or specific plan
   - Introduces the conceptual environment for innovation/disruption
   - Bad: "MCW Theranostics Expansion Plan"
   - Good: "Precision Milwaukee"

3. **Use Language Suggesting Scope, Tension, or Possibility**
   - Powerful landscapes imply movement, conflict, or potential
   - Can hint at risk, opportunity, or disruption
   - Examples:
     - "The Data Sovereignty Wars"
     - "America's Second Brain Drain"
     - "Climate Control Collapse"
     - "Post-AI Ethics Crisis"

4. **Let It Be Defined by Issues**
   - The landscape is just the naming container
   - Meaning comes from the issues explored within it
   - Dynamic, not static - evolves as new issues emerge

5. **Use It to Bound Inquiry**
   - Everything analyzed must be relevant to this landscape
   - Prevents cognitive overload
   - Keeps discovery aligned with strategic aims

---

## STEP 3: Issues (The Battles Within)

### Definition

An **Issue** is a specific event, phenomenon, or situation within a defined landscape that:
- Demands explanation
- Holds strategic significance
- Is the building block of discovery analysis

Each issue is framed around three analytical questions:
1. **What happened?** (The observable fact, event, or shift)
2. **Why is it happening?** (The underlying drivers)
3. **What happens next?** (The plausible implications)

### How to Identify and Analyze Issues

1. **Anchor to the Landscape**
   - Every issue must fit within your defined landscape
   - Ask: Does this issue belong in the world I named?
   - Example in "Precision Milwaukee": GE Healthcare opens a theranostics R&D lab in Wauwatosa

2. **Frame with Three Key Questions**

   Example:
   - What happened? CMS approved reimbursement for a new radiotracer
   - Why is it happening? Growing demand for cost-effective precision oncology
   - What happens next? Regional providers rush to adopt theranostics protocols

3. **Ensure Issues Are Tension-Bearing**
   - Good issues create uncertainty
   - Reflect dynamic forces with multiple plausible outcomes
   - Generate strategic friction stakeholders care about
   - Avoid trivial or settled facts

4. **Use ACH-Style Thinking (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)**
   - Identify at least two competing explanations
   - Reveals where certainty is fragile

   Example - Cancer patients delay treatment:
   - Explanation 1: Economic hardship from inflation
   - Explanation 2: Distrust in new treatment modalities
   - Implication: Each leads to different product/policy response

5. **Catalog Issues for Stakeholder and Trend Analysis**
   - Each issue reveals who has something at stake (stakeholders)
   - Shows what forces are beyond anyone's control (trends)
   - Creates bridge from narrative to actionable intelligence

---

## STEP 4: Stakeholders (The Actors)

### Definition

A **Stakeholder** is any person, group, institution, or system that stands to gain or lose as a result of how an issue evolves within a landscape.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Revealed by issues (not assumed in advance)
- Emerge when analyzing who influences or is influenced by events
- Defined by two factors:
  - **Power** (level of influence over the issue)
  - **Stake** (level of interest in the outcome)

### How to Identify and Analyze Stakeholders

1. **Let Issues Reveal Stakeholders**
   - Ask: Who wins or loses depending on how this plays out?
   - And: Who can cause this to play out one way or another?

   Example (CMS approves new radiotracer):
   - MCW clinicians and researchers
   - Private insurers
   - Radiopharmaceutical companies
   - Cancer patients in southeastern Wisconsin
   - Competing academic centers (e.g., Mayo Clinic)

2. **Classify by Power and Stake**

   | | High Stake | Low Stake |
   |---|---|---|
   | **High Power** | Strategic Allies/Threats | Indirect Influencers |
   | **Low Power** | Mobilizers/Advocates | Peripheral Observers |

   Focus closest attention on high power/high stake quadrant.

3. **Distinguish Active vs Passive Stakeholders**
   - **Active**: Making choices now or soon
   - **Passive**: May be affected but not moving yet - watch for future action
   - Example: Large hospital network may be passive until economics change

4. **Map Motivations, Constraints, and Levers**

   For each stakeholder analyze:
   - What do they want? (incentives)
   - What do they fear? (risks)
   - What limits their actions? (regulations, budgets, culture)
   - What tools do they control? (technology, policy, capital, media)

   Example - MCW Radiology Dept:
   - Motive: Academic prestige and research funding
   - Constraint: Staffing shortages and reimbursement delays
   - Lever: Access to GE's experimental tech and NIH grants

5. **Cluster and Prioritize**
   - Group by shared attributes or opposing positions
   - Prioritize those most critical to hypothesis/strategy

   In "Precision Milwaukee":
   - Clinical partners
   - Payers and regulators
   - Competing institutions
   - Patient communities and advocacy groups

## STEP 5: Trends (The Currents)

### Definition

A **Trend** is a persistent force or directional change that is:
- Largely outside anyone's direct control
- Shapes behavior and outcomes of stakeholders and issues
- The underlying currents conditioning what's possible, probable, and preventable

Also referred to as **Contingency Control Factors** or **Uncontrollables**.

> Trends answer: "What long-range shifts are everyone reacting to, but no one can unilaterally stop?"

### How to Identify and Analyze Trends

1. **Use the STEEPLED Framework**

   | Category | Examples |
   |----------|----------|
   | **S**ocial | Demographic shifts, values changes |
   | **T**echnological | AI in diagnostic imaging, automation |
   | **E**conomic | Value-based reimbursement, inflation |
   | **E**cological | Climate change, resource scarcity |
   | **P**olitical | NIH/CMS funding pressures |
   | **L**egal | Regulatory changes |
   | **E**thical | Privacy concerns, AI ethics |
   | **D**emographic | Aging population, cancer incidence |

2. **Ensure Uncontrollable but Relevant**
   - Should affect multiple stakeholders
   - Not owned or directed by any single player
   - Must be strategically relevant to landscape
   - Good: "Declining trust in centralized healthcare systems"
   - Bad: "MCW's hiring of a new radiologist" (this is an event, not a trend)

3. **Distinguish Trends from Issues**
   - **Issues**: Immediate, specific, often debated
   - **Trends**: Persistent, directional, structural

   Example:
   - Issue: CMS approved reimbursement for radiotracers
   - Trend: Healthcare system moving toward precision, data-driven care

4. **Surface Risk and Opportunity**

   Ask how each trend:
   - Constrains stakeholder actions
   - Creates opportunity for innovation
   - Alters the playing field over time

   Example - Legal restrictions on radiological waste:
   - Constrains expansion of theranostics labs
   - Opportunity for startups with safe, compliant waste solutions

5. **Visualize or Cluster**
   - Group trends by how they affect same stakeholders
   - Map against key issues
   - Clarify which trends shape which parts of landscape

## Putting It All Together

### Process Flow
```
Narrative Estimate → Landscape → Issues → Stakeholders → Trends
```

### Outputs by Stage

| Stage | Output | Tool |
|-------|--------|------|
| Narrative Estimate | Hypothesis | Strategic vision document |
| Landscape | Scope definition | PowerPoint Slide 1 |
| Issues | Event analysis | PowerPoint Slides 2-N |
| Stakeholders | Actor map | Influence vs Interest matrix |
| Trends | Force inventory | STEEPLED table with relevance tags |

### Key Principle

Use LIST in cycles, across domains, to sharpen insight and decision-making in **VUCA** conditions:
- **V**olatile
- **U**ncertain
- **C**omplex
- **A**mbiguous

---

## Summary

The LIST model transforms fantastical hypotheses into actionable intelligence through structured analysis of:

1. **Landscape**: The named world you're exploring
2. **Issues**: Strategically relevant situations within that world
3. **Stakeholders**: Anyone who wins or loses based on issue evolution
4. **Trends**: Non-negotiable external forces conditioning all choices

The process bridges imagination (Narrative Estimate) to market reality (Market Segment Selection) through rigorous, systematic discovery.

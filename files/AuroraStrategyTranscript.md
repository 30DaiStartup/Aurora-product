# Aurora Strategy Planning Session Transcript

*Internal discussion on Aurora's Intelligence Operating System product strategy*

---

## Executive Summary

This transcript captures a strategic planning session focused on Aurora's pivot to an Intelligence Operating System product, modeled on how Agile proliferated as a methodology with its own lexicon, roles, and terminology.

---

## Key Strategic Concepts Discussed

### The Intelligence Operating System Vision

The foundational product is an **Intelligence Operating System** deployed through an intellectual property framework - similar to how Agile proliferated:

- New project management methodology competing with waterfall
- Created a whole new lexicon
- New roles that people would fill
- New terminology and words
- Attacked inefficiencies of waterfall planning

### The Pivot from Recon G2

**Key Insight**: Leadership had an "aha moment" recognizing the need to deprioritize the current Recon G2 product in favor of the new SuperCycle-based approach.

> "I can't mess around with Recon G2 anymore when this is right on my doorstep."

## Product Strategy Framework

### Simplification Principle

> "It seems so simple - not easy, simple - and much simpler than we've made it on ourselves, lo these past almost 31 years."

The strategy focuses on clarity and simplification after years of complexity.

### Core Components

1. **SuperCycle Methodology** - The intellectual property framework
2. **Aurora Office Suite** - Software tools (Discovery, Optimality, Simulation)
3. **Certification Program** - Aurora Institute certifications
4. **Roles Framework** - Landscape Architect, Superiority Strategist, Simulation Commander, SuperCycle Master

## Implementation Approach

### 40-Hour to 40-Minute Vision

The goal is to enable analysts to complete what previously took 40 hours in just 40 minutes using AI automation.

### Existing Customer Conversion

Strategy includes converting existing "First Light" customers to the new suite.

### Success Metrics

Potential milestone-based goals:
- Number of systems installed
- First Light customers converted to new suite
- Revenue targets (e.g., $1M from new business by year-end)

---

## Organizational Considerations

### Role Evolution

Discussion of how roles might evolve:
- **CEO to Product Owner**: Derek potentially transitioning from CEO title to "Product Owner of the SuperCycle Suite"
- **Head of Product role**: Defining Zach Henderson's role in the new business structure

### Resource Allocation

Key questions to address:
- What does the Head of Product role look like?
- What's the min/max cost range?
- What's the "Goldilocks" middle ground?

### Shared Risk Model

Proposal for incentive-based compensation structure:
- Lower upfront costs
- Success-based bonuses tied to milestones
- Shared risk appetite between company and key employees

> "I am perfectly fine betting on myself as well and where I think this can go."

---

## Success Requirements

### Accountability Framework

For success-based compensation to work:
- Clear mechanism for addressing blockers
- Ability to quickly identify when someone isn't performing
- Leadership team discussions about getting the right people in the right roles

> "We're talking about a completely different mindset shift and a lot of new things that people are just going to have to be comfortable trying and failing at."

### Fail Fast Philosophy

Emphasis on:
- Proving capabilities through action
- Quick iteration when things don't work
- Getting "the right person in this role" when needed

---

## Key Quotes

On the product vision:
> "This is the conceptualization of an Intelligence Operating System being the foundational product."

On the Agile parallel:
> "Agile created a whole new lexicon, new roles that people would fill, new terminology, new words."

On organizational readiness:
> "We can't have a weak link in this chain right now if we're going to meet our goals."

On incentive alignment:
> "If we succeed, which I expect we will succeed, then everyone's going to be very happy and blessed."

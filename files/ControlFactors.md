# Control Factors: Translating Insight Into Action

*By Arik Johnson, Founder & Chairman, Aurora WDC*

## Overview

Control Factors represent the three domains of power used by choice-making actors to project control over their operating environment. This framework transforms traditional Key Intelligence Topics (KITs) into actionable intelligence by categorizing choices based on the actor's ability to express power.

## Key Definitions

### Control Factors

The three domains of power for projecting control over an operating environment:

| Factor | Definition | Controls |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Dominion Factors** | Choices you, your leadership, or organization controls | Internal decisions, resources, strategy |
| **Contingency Factors** | Choices stakeholders must cope with, largely uncontrollable by anyone | External macro-environment forces |
| **Influence Factors** | Choices another stakeholder controls that you might influence | Competitor/partner actions |

### Related Concepts

**Stakeholders**: The diverse population of owners, operators, staff, clients, and ecosystem partners an actor must consider when choosing pathways to outcomes. They share a stake in outcomes and have potential/actual incentives to act in self-interest.

**Actor Choices**: The intentional sacrifice of less optimal options based on understanding simulated consequences, in favor of more certain, imminent, and impactful choices expected to lead to successful results.

**Undercertainties**: Outstanding questions preventing translation of insights into actions at each phase of analytic metamorphosis. Until resolved, progress is impeded.

## Background: From KITs to Control Factors

### Historical Context

Control Factors originate from Stoic philosophy but were adapted from "Key Intelligence Topics" (KITs) developed for national security intelligence (CIA's Cold War era science and technology analysis).

### Problems with Traditional KITs

The KIT protocols had significant shortcomings:

| KIT Category | Shorthand | Problem |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Strategic Decisions | What's Happening Inside | Vague definitions led to confusion |
| Key Market Players | What's Happening Outside | Became "nice to know" profiling exercises |
| Early Warning Topics | What's Happening Future | Not inherently actionable |

**Key Issue**: Insular intelligence nomenclature led to misunderstandings between analysts and decision makers - they spoke different "languages."

### The Translation Solution

Jan Herring (who brought KITs from CIA to Motorola) endorsed the redefinition: "I wish I would have called it that in the 1980s because I think people would have used it better."

## The Three Control Factor Domains

### 1. Dominion Factors (What You Control)

Choices the actor controls which others largely do not.

**Components:**
- National, organizational, group, or personal identity
- Mission and vision
- Strategy
- Operating systems
- Measurement and management systems

**Key Principle**: The inventory should begin with identity/vision/mission, then cascade through organizational parameters from strategic to operational to managerial systems.

**Application**: Strategic Decisions and Issues feature prominently here, arraying choices the actor can exert unopposed power over.

### 2. Contingency Factors (What Nobody Controls)

The "uncontrollables" the actor must deal or cope with.

**Components (STEEPLED Framework):**
- **S**ocial
- **T**echnological
- **E**conomic
- **E**cological
- **P**olitical
- **L**egislative
- **E**thical
- **D**emographic

**Application**: Aligned with Early Warning topics - trends and forces outside the actor's sphere of influence that must be dealt with to survive or thrive.

### 3. Influence Factors (What Others Control)

The dominion and contingency factors of other actors and their constituents/competitors.

**Key Concept**: Calibrate a degree-of-influence range to forecast probability of directing other stakeholders to more desirable choices.

**Application**: Often by helping stakeholders discover, optimize, and test choices they were previously unaware of. Related to geopolitical "Spheres of Influence."

## The Three-Phase Metamorphosis

Insights transform into actionable results through three stages, each decreasing risk from less desirable or unintended consequences:

### Phase 1: Discovery

**Purpose**: Broaden perspectives about the choice universe to establish boundaries and ensure higher-resolution understanding of reality.

**Undercertain Questions by Control Factor:**

| Factor | Discovery Question |
|--------|-------------------|
| Dominion | Which issues and interests are we aligned to support or conflict with? |
| Contingency | Which landscape trends and forces are most imminent, impactful, and certain? |
| Influence | Who has an interest in our landscape's future and how much influence do we have? |

### Phase 2: Optimality

**Purpose**: Select optimal choices and sacrifice sub-optimal alternatives based on expected results aligned with stakeholder preferences (Superiority Criteria).

**Undercertain Questions by Control Factor:**

| Factor | Optimality Question |
|--------|---------------------|
| Dominion | Which stakeholder superiority criteria will we satisfy, drive, and disrupt? |
| Contingency | Which forces trending for or against us will we need to deal with? |
| Influence | Which stakeholder superiority criteria must we direct to our advantage, and in which order? |

### Phase 3: Testing

**Purpose**: Simulate expected results against other stakeholders' interests, revealing emotional or illogical nature of stakeholder choice-making.

**Undercertain Questions by Control Factor:**

| Factor | Testing Question |
|--------|------------------|
| Dominion | How might we recalibrate operations to ensure longer-term stakeholder superiority perception? |
| Contingency | How do trends and forces intersect to narrate our ideal final result? |
| Influence | How will stakeholders respond (for or against), and how will we react to improve desirability of probable results? |

## The Action Graph

### Three Variable Dimensions

Actor variables are visualized and prioritized against three dimensions:

```
       Y ↑
         │ Imminence
         │
         │
    Z    │
    ↗    │
Certainty│────────────→ X
                      Impact
```

1. **Impact (X-axis)**: How important is this action variable?
2. **Imminence (Y-axis)**: How urgently might this occur?
3. **Certainty (Z-axis)**: How sure are we? (The critical differentiator)

**Key Innovation**: While the first two axes are common in prioritizing variables, adding certainty addresses the key shortcoming of most planning - higher executive confidence is explicitly considered.

## Control Factor Qualities

| Dominion | Contingency | Influence |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Strategic choices influencing success | Signals of industry change | Outcomes of competitive confrontations |
| Involve options and choices | Coping with developing macro-environment | Understanding and engaging stakeholders |
| Emerging and existing choices that must be made | Future-oriented, dynamic, conceptual | People/organization-focused |

---

## Practical Applications

### Business Context

The definition of firm strategy is often mysterious to all but the most sophisticated stakeholders. This mystique makes execution vulnerable to other control factors.

**Key Insight**: Operating in a silo and assuming the greater landscape will work in your favor renders strategies needlessly rigid and fragile.

**Stakeholder Interests**: Financial performance, firm valuation, market share acquisition, liability minimization - but each stakeholder type may have contradicting interests.

### Government Context

Public policy is usually partisan and increasingly identitarian. Ulterior motives and "backroom" deal-making lead to perceptions of legislative gridlock and bureaucratic overreach.

**Key Insight**: The bureaucracy executing laws can be considered its own stakeholder class, sometimes in competition with taxpayer/voter desired results.

---

## Practical Guidelines

1. **More careful understanding of undercertainties** makes control factor choices easier, less risky, and more productive

2. **None of the control factors should be viewed in a vacuum** - holistic understanding enables confident, quick progress

3. **Phase purposes**:
   - Discovery: Reveal and identify landscape boundaries
   - Optimality: Select and sacrifice available options
   - Testing: Challenge and invalidate expectations

4. **Testing is always necessary** - even when you feel you know what to do after Optimality, simulation reveals stakeholder reactions, biases, emotions, and hidden options

5. **Factor types**:
   - Dominion: Choices and controversies
   - Contingency: Issues and trends
   - Influence: Choices/controversies and issues/trends of others

6. **Ideal outcome**: An **anti-fragile hypothesis** - a strategy that gets stronger under expected stress, prepared for inevitable impediments

---

## Conclusion

Control Factors are primarily helpful in revealing landscape boundaries and stakeholder interests whenever insights are insufficiently certain (undercertain) to select or sacrifice optimal options.

**Core Principle**: Dominion is not driven in a vacuum - uncontrollable Contingency factors must be dealt with, while directing Influence factors of other actors more intentionally creates desirable results.

**Ultimate Goal**: Disciplined application of control factors strengthens strategy and creates more confident choice-making, enabling actors to become stronger when tested under real-world stakeholder encounters.

# Angles of Attack

## Overview

The Angles of Attack framework describes four generic strategic curves that characterize all business evolution over time: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. This framework provides a programmable context for understanding competitive dynamics, superiority criteria, and market disruption.

## Core Concept

Disruptive technologies always start out being relatively low quality before they climb the bottom half of the S-curve. Every technology spends considerable time being low quality before eventually reaching medium, high, and most demanding use - before being subsumed by another technology.

The fundamental problem with disruptive technology theory is that it appears relatively hopeless for established companies - they almost always lose, usually due to failure to adjust their attitude. The Angles of Attack framework provides a programmable context to address this.

## The Four Angles of Attack

### Alpha (Market Leaders)

- **Definition**: The leader(s) of the market
- **Vulnerability**: Continue investing in capacity/capabilities that eventually overshoot the highest quality uses
- **Risk**: Primary performance parameter becomes too expensive, complicated, or costly for existing demand
- **Example**: Sears in 1970 building the world's tallest skyscraper while Walmart was expanding nationally - a decade of managerial distraction led to their decline

### Beta (Value Chain Specialists)

- **Definition**: Specialists within the value chain who enable cost structure advantages that Alphas cannot match
- **Strategy**: Alphas willingly surrender portions of the marketplace to Betas because they don't consider them threats
- **Outcome**: By the time Betas reach the sweet spot in the market, Alphas have overshot tremendously

### Gamma (Disruptive Innovators)

- **Definition**: Competitors who create new curves out of nothing by addressing nascent expectations of demand
- **Characteristics**:
  - Addresses needs customers can't even articulate
  - Creates offers not yet good enough to unlock a new Alpha curve
  - Improvable by other market entrants
- **Example**: iPhone improved upon Android's gamma (removing keys from smartphone form-factor). Google responded by funding Android to create a Beta competing with Apple's new Alpha.

### Delta (Category Creators)

- **Definition**: Creation of a new category addressing a non-consuming context
- **Characteristics**: Pure imagination-driven innovation
- **Impact**: Calls into question the relevance of existing offers, making them irrelevant
- **Example**: Telepathic communication - until recently pure Delta, now a Gamma with actual thought-broadcasting capability

## Key Principle

**Customer expectations (superiority criteria) always grow at a slower rate than your ability to express control factors programmed to meet that superiority criteria.**

This creates the fundamental dynamic where:
- Alphas overshoot customer expectations
- Betas and Gammas exploit this by creating cost structure or relevance advantages

## Superiority Criteria

Three types of superiority criteria drive competitive dynamics:

### Satisfiers
- Things every market provider must do
- Providers always try to over-deliver on satisfiers
- **Market never rewards over-delivery on satisfiers**
- Beta/Gamma curves exploit Alpha over-delivery by creating cost structure advantages

### Drivers
- Create temporary advantage rewarded with market share
- Competitors have three choices:
  1. **Imitate** - copy the driver
  2. **Leapfrog** - improve upon the driver
  3. **Surrender** - accept inevitable loss and exit
- Surrender is hardest for Alphas to accept but sometimes inevitable (Sears took 49 years to surrender to Walmart)

### Disruptors
- Characteristics that attack jobs-for-hire of existing offers
- Make existing offers irrelevant
- Example: BlackBerry's keys became irrelevant when widescreen browsing required their removal

## Control Factors (Reinterpreted KITs)

Traditional Key Intelligence Topics (KITs) redefined as Control Factors:

| Original KIT | Control Factor | Definition |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Strategic Decisions | Factors You Control | Choices influencing success |
| Early Warning Topics | Factors Nobody Controls | Megatrends and signals of industry change |
| Key Market Players | Factors Others Control | Which you might influence |

This reinterpretation makes intelligence more actionable - the litmus test for competitive intelligence.

## Finite vs Infinite Game

- **Finite Players**: Playing to win (US in Vietnam, traditional corporations)
- **Infinite Players**: Playing to keep playing (North Vietnamese, adaptive companies like RIM/BlackBerry)

> "We didn't lose the game, we just ran out of time." - Vince Lombardi

Key insight: If you're a finite player in an infinite game, you will eventually fumble the ball through unforced errors.

## The Growth Champion Mindset

The infinite game for competitive intelligence is to become **champions for growth** in the organizations they serve.

- **Skill Set**: 900+ analytical techniques and tools
- **Mindset**: Growth champion orientation that makes the skill set necessary

> "If you lack the mindset, it doesn't matter what your skill set is because it will be eliminated with extreme prejudice when the business cycle turns."

## Practical Application

1. Program superiority criteria the market rewards
2. Connect criteria to control factors
3. Determine your angle of attack (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta)
4. Create an anti-fragile strategy that gets stronger under stress
5. Embrace the growth champion identity

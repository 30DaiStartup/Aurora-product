# LIST Model: Conceptual Explanation Transcript

## The Discovery Framework

Discovery, in the form of the LIST, has never actually been done before. It is theoretical, but it is a model that could not be done without AI to automate specifically the issues stage.

### The Narrative Estimate

The SuperCycle requires a precursor input for each of the three stages. The precursor input for discovery is called the **Narrative Estimate**.

**Definition**: A narrative estimate is just a statement about reality that is largely fantastical. It doesn't even have to be completely true - it has to be a hypothesis.

**Analogy**: The transformation from narrative estimate to actionable esteem is analogous to rewriting *The Hobbit* into *The Martian*. It's scientifically brilliant, but also fantastical - a never-been-done-before kind of thing. But at least there's no wizards and dragons and magic - nothing supernatural about the actionable esteem, which is what makes it actionable.

> "The narrative estimate is supernatural in the form of, at this point in the stage, a miracle happens."

This is how many hypotheses about the future are constructed - based upon miracles appearing in predictably unpredictable ways.

## The LIST Model Breakdown

### L - Landscape

The narrative estimate begins with the **L** in LIST - the **Landscape**.

- The landscape is really just the title - like the title slide of your PowerPoint
- You're basically just giving it nomenclature and name
- It will be defined by whatever shows up in the PowerPoint itself (the issues)

**Example**: "The Global Margin Call" as the landscape name, with contents roughly approximating the world economy, allowing investigation of millions of issues.

### I - Issues

The headline of your landscape is defined first and foremost by the **issues** occurring in that landscape.

**Structure**: Each issue involves:
1. **What happened?**
2. **Why is it happening?**
3. **What happens next?**

**Example Issue**: Putin invades Ukraine
- What happened? [The invasion]
- Why is it happening? [Geopolitical factors]
- What happens next? [Multiple scenarios]

**Methodology**: Issues analysis is based on **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** - a technique suggesting there is a minimum of two possible explanations for what happened, why it's happening, and what happens next.

### S - Stakeholders

The issues analysis process reveals who the stakeholders are.

**Definition**: A stakeholder is anyone who can win or lose as a result of how an issue evolves over time.

**Stakeholder Matrix Dimensions**:

1. **Power (Influence)**: High to Low
2. **Interest (Stake)**: High to Low (more binary - either on or off)

**Quadrant Analysis**:

| | High Interest | Low Interest |
|---|---|---|
| **High Influence** | Really, really matter | Less critical |
| **Low Influence** | Still revealed during analysis | Don't matter much |

### T - Trends

Trends can be expressed as **Contingency Control Factors**, also known as **Uncontrollables**.

**Definition**: Choices that stakeholders must make when producing the LIST on behalf of another stakeholder.

**STEEPLED Framework**:
- **S**ocial
- **T**echnological
- **E**conomic
- **E**cological
- **P**olitical
- **L**egal
- **E**thical
- **D**emographic

These uncontrollables are similar to stakeholder control factors being confronted by other stakeholders as well.

## From Narrative Estimate to Market Segment Selection

The output of the LIST model is the **Market Segment Selection**.

### The Transformation

```
Narrative Estimate → LIST Analysis → Market Segment Selection
```

The market segment selection is really the selection of a **buyer** from that stakeholder population based upon the uncontrollables they have to cope with to survive.

### Key Insight: Offer vs. Invention

> "Your offer is no longer whatever your invention was."

Traditional intelligence and insights approach: "Hey, I have this pen. Who can I sell it to?"

**The correct approach**: The offer is whatever you invent NOW that solves the problem of the segment you have identified as being high value, with:
- Felt need
- Ability to buy
- Your ability to create/innovate and bring to market

## Connecting to Optimality

### The Angles of Attack

Optimality begins with **Angles of Attack**, not with your offer.

**Questions to answer**:
1. Who are you? (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta)
2. Who are the incumbent competitors in the market segment right now?
3. What will their cascade of choices look like to achieve optimal alignment of their superiority criteria with the market segment's superiority criteria?

> "It doesn't matter which segment they have chosen. It matters only if they've chosen the same segment that you have."

## AI and Efficiency

### The 40-Hour to 40-Minute Transformation

> "This is a 40-hour work project that an analyst can do in 40 minutes."

Without AI, a human analyst would spend months conducting this process. With AI automation (particularly for the issues stage), this becomes dramatically accelerated.

## Practical Implementation

### Mastering LIST - Step by Step

**Landscape (L)**
- Definition: Understand the macro-environment, identifying boundaries to focus on relevant factors
- Practice: Map out industry including competitors, market size, regulatory environment

**Issues (I)**
- Definition: Pinpoint challenges, hurdles, or problems within landscape impacting strategy
- Practice: Identify market entry barriers, customer pain points, regulatory changes

**Stakeholders (S)**
- Definition: Anyone who wins or loses from issue evolution
- Practice: Map by power/influence and interest/stake

**Trends (T)**
- Definition: Uncontrollable forces expressed through STEEPLED framework
- Practice: Analyze macro-environment factors affecting all stakeholders

## Key Takeaways

1. **Discovery has never been done this way before** - it required AI to make it practical

2. **The narrative estimate is the starting point** - a fantastical but plausible hypothesis about reality

3. **Issues drive everything** - they reveal stakeholders and trends through systematic analysis

4. **The output is market segment selection** - not starting with your product, but with the buyer's needs

5. **Optimality begins with knowing your angle of attack** - understanding your position relative to competitors

6. **AI enables 100x efficiency gains** - transforming months of work into hours
